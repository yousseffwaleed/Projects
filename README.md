# Capstone ML Model Experiments

This repository contains initial experimentation and modeling work for my capstone project on RF signal classification using deep learning.

## ðŸ§  Models Included
- `CNN_1DConv.py`: 1D CNN for temporal feature extraction
- `CNN_2DConv.py`: 2D CNN for spectrogram-based inputs
- `CNN_LSTM.py`: Hybrid CNN + LSTM model
- `CNN_LSTM_1DConv_hybrid.py`: Combined convolution and recurrent architecture
- `CNN_ResNet_preT.py`: Transfer learning using pre-trained ResNet

## ðŸ“„ Documentation
- `Capstone_ML_Initial_Experimentation.docx`: Describes methods, metrics, and observations

## ðŸ“¦ Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

## ðŸ§ª Goal
To evaluate deep learning architectures for classifying wireless signal-based data collected using software-defined radios.
